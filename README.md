# Classification-Project
This is a Classification Project with following objectives:

1. Exploring and Preprocessing Data
2. Build different classification models to predict the mobile phone price range
3. Price range prediction for usnseen data with a total size of 1000.

The project includes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis,
2. Feature Selection using RandomForest,
3. Noise Reduction for noise sensitive algorithms usin KNN Imputer,
4. 3 trained models: Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.
5. Model Evaluation.
6. Price range prediction for the test data with the best performed model.
